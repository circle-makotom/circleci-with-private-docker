# Quick Start

1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Go to https://circleci.com/ or your own CircleCI Server instance, and setup a project for your forked repository.
3. Set up environment variables `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`. Please contact me for the values you have to set for them.
4. Rerun the workflow from beginning.

You should have a green build then!
